Household blinds currently require manual operation to allow a desired amount of natural light through, to illuminate one’s living space. With varying weather and brightness throughout the day, it can become quite tedious to constantly shut or open the blinds for the desired effect within one’s room. Intellux aims to automate this process by sensing the light within and outside the room and adjusting the blinds to bring in the desired amount of natural light. Intellux can help achieve energy efficiency through strategies to reduce artificial lighting by intelligent daylight utilization.
